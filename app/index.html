                        <p>
                            When I was growing up, the fall brought Halloween, the winter brought Christmas, and the spring rains brought the Easter Bunny, but best of all, the summer brought the seashore house. To me, the seashore house meant a wonderland of things to see and do. Finding lost treasures from the year before, exploring the uninhabited land, fishing with my grandfather, going to the boardwalk, and playing on the never-ending beach. These are the things my favorite childhood memories are made of.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Crowded in the car with my mom, dad, brother and sisters, we would be squashed together with all the items that would be needed for a perfect  vacation. Our anticipation of the big arrival at the seashore house would be rising as we pulled up into the gravel driveway. Springing out of the, car we gathered miscellaneous items that were used for our entertainment on the long drive down. As we entered the house, the familiar aroma of the oak paneling and the sting of the salty air reminded me of summers past. After struggling with our suitcases, it was time for our parents to unwind from the two hour drive that felt like five hours. My brother, sisters, and I had done enough sitting on the way down; it was time to explore the house. We searched the house for lost Barbie dolls, coloring books, and other childhood treasures we knew we had left the year before.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Left to pursue our own pleasures while our parents put the house in order, we virtually burst out the back door, flew across the wooden deck, down the stairs, and into the outdoor paradise my grandparents called their summer home. My first priority was to explore under the house.Built upon stilts, this was where we played on cold rainy days, but it was always my favorite spot.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            After I was satisfied that it was still the same, I went to explore another, the MARSH! This is where i would search for turtles and other creatures of the sea shore. As I would walk through the spooky marsh, the tall grass would swipe at my face and I would sink into the soft muddy land, sometimes losing my shoe in the mud. I would feel like I was being sucked into the earth.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            While searching for creatures, I would sometimes spot my Grandfather walking to the dock to fish. I would immediately drop what I was doing and run after him. When my short legs finally caught up to his long strides, I was rewarded with a smile and the honor of carrying his fishing rod and bait box. Together we went down the long street to the decrepit old dock. There we sat on the old benches waiting for the fish to nibble on the lines. We knew it could take hours before we saw any life in the sea, but that did not matter to us. The joy of our fishing was not just catching fish, it was sitting with someone whom I loved, and enjoying the scenery of the deep mysterious bay. As the sun went down and our bait was eaten by all the fish we did not catch, it was time for us to go back to the house where we knew Grandmom  had prepared a wonderful meal.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Sitting at the long table with my family around me, we would discuss what the night was going to bring. The BOARDWALK! Piling into the car with smiles that reached our ears, we would decide what ride we would go to first. My favorite was the flying elephant ride. As I was on the elephant, preferably the purple one, I would imagine how wonderful it would be to take off and fly my purple elephant across the ocean and into the deep, dark sky. Unfortunately, the ride always ended before I could fly away. Just like the elephant adventure, the books of tickets in my parents hands disappeared. Our faces lost their smiles and found their frowns, but in their quest to keep us happy, my parents always knew how to end the night well: double-dipped cones with sprinkles for everyone. After we finished our ice cream, which we wore as well as tasted, we would pile back into the car, eager to get back to the house and snuggle in bed in anticipation of waking up early to go to the BEACH!
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Walking to the beach with towels, blankets, buckets, and shovels, we must have looked like we were moving. While my parents would find the perfect spot to set up our “camping site,” I would run to the ocean  to check on the temperature. Always hesitant to go in by myself, I could be persuaded if my father offered to take me in. After a few times of being washed away by waves, I would decide that my father had to help me build a sandcastle. Sometimes I had "castle competitions" with my brother  and sisters. I would always try to make mine fancy with feathers from seagulls, sells, and other items that were washed ashore. By this time, I felt like a sand monster and was ready to return to the water and find my skin again. After tumbling around the sea for a second  time, I was ready to face my next adventure. Sand Castles and seahorses, rides and ice cream cones, these are the memories of my childhood summers. I always felt fortunate that I had this wonderful place to go and explore each summer. In fact, that house still stands today, offering summertime wonders to a whole new generation.
